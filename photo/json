LLS is making cures happen by providing patient support services, advocacy for lifesaving treatments and the most promising cancer research anywhere. And it's all happening now. Not someday, but today.\n\nFriends, families and co-workers form fundraising teams, and consumers help by donating at retail outlets. These efforts culminate in inspirational, evening walks in nearly 200 communities across North America each fall.\n\nLight The Night Walks are people coming together to inspire, motivate, and take an active role in finding cures.\nDuring these evening leisurely walks, Champions For Cures carry illuminated lanterns - white for survivors, red for supporters and gold in memory of loved ones lost to a blood cancer.\n\nRegister today: http://pages.lightthenight.org/nc/Raleigh15", "name": "Raleigh Light The Night Walk"}{"description": "Interest meeting/practice for a Raleigh-Durham travel kickball team for 2016.
