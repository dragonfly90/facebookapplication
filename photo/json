This particular sitting will include an overview of the weekend discussing the three routes to achieve dharana. \n\nSaturday \n12:30-2:30 pm  A Steady Place\nPranayama in full context contains more than breathing and embodies the idea of directing, controlling or moving the most basic unit of measured energy within the form to achieve levels of dharana (meditation) that lead one to a state of yoga. The breath is used a tool for study and experiential knowledge as prana can be defined as cosmic knowledge. This workshop will include a brief lecture on postures used to gain prana and a steady position (sometimes to referred to as kaya-mudra) for the practice of higher aspects of control of psychic breath. The main practices will include a variety of breathing practices that can be integrated into a sadhana. The workshop is suitable for all levels and can aid in healing and/or healing all practices. \n\n230-430 pm Transcendence \nTraditional practice of Sanskrit mantra is the technique of directing the breath through energetic channels within the physical form to create sound and energetic response yielding a vibration that invokes purification of the physical body, stillness of the mind and re-alignment with life purpose. When practiced with intention and consistency Sanskrit mantra has the ability to bring about whatever change the practitioner seeks. This workshop will include a general overview of the Sanskrit language, a review of different forms of mantra, their lineages and methodology of practice. We will focus on classical call and response as well as repetition. Mantras will include short seed sounds and powerful yet simple sound combinations. Attendees will leave with the knowledge and ability to begin their own home practice.

For many of these kids and their caregivers, diagnosis with a critical or terminal illness impacts them indefinitely. Their lives are thrown into permanent chaos. In addition to the unfathomable emotional burdens that now face these families, the costs of being treated become immense as they often helplessly watch their financial lives unravel. \n\nThe Me Fine Foundation exists so that these children and their families will not walk through their journeys with disease alone. Me Fine provides critical financial assistance and vital emotional support. Our programs are designed to keep families together so that children can have the best chance for recovery possible. No insurance plan will help provide what Me Fine does, which is why YOUR SUPPORT IS SO CRITICAL.\n\nThe Annual Me Fine Gala is our signature fundraising event. Our foundation receives no funding from federal, state or local government. We rely totally on the generosity of our donors and corporate partners and on the success of this event.\n\nIf you want to help fight for these medically fragile children, believe in the work we're doing, and want to see stronger families making for a better community, please consider being a part of our event!  \n\nSee pictures from last years event here: \nhttp://www.mefinefoundation.org/2014-mefine-gala-foundations-successful-fundraiser-date/nggallery/slideshow\n\nPlease share with your friends and family!", "start_time": "2015-09-26T19:00:00-0400", "place": {"id": "263878873657136", "name": "City Club Raleigh", "location": {"city": "Raleigh", "zip": "27601", "country": "United States", "longitude": -78.6397018, "state": "NC", "street": "150 Fayetteville St", "latitude": 35.7787209}}, "end_time": "2015-09-26T23:00:00-0400", "id": "1644140499133473", "name": "Annual Me Fine Gala"}{"description": "The most anticipated party of 2015.

Inspired by the original 1936 film of the same name, this raucous musical comedy takes a tongue-in-cheek look at the hysteria caused when clean-cut kids fall prey to marijuana, leading them on a hysterical downward spiral filled with evil jazz music, sex, and violence.  The addictive and clever musical numbers range from big Broadway-style showstoppers to swing tunes like \u201dDown at the Ol' Five and Dime\u201d and the Vegas-style \u201dListen to Jesus, Jimmy,\u201d featuring J.C. Himself leading a chorus of showgirl angels. Reefer Madness is a highly stylized satirical political commentary. It contains adult humor and  religious parody, as well as suggested violence and sexual situations.\n\n\"A delirious romp, which at its best reaches highs of intoxicating goofiness.\" \u2013Elysa Gardner, USA Today.\n\n\"REEFER MADNESS...is deliberately outlandish and silly.

Make sure to get here early and grab a beer at the bar!\n\nDale Watson Bio:\nDale Watson is a honky tonk hero and country music maverick, a true outlaw carrying on where Waylon Jennings left off. A member of the Austin Music Hall of Fame, he stands alongside Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and George Strait as one of the finest country singers and songwriters from the Lone Star State. Although Dale has made his name as a Texas artist, he actually was born in Alabama. Moving to Houston as a teenager, his musical journey began right out of high school as he started playing clubs and local honky-tonks. In 1988, it led him to move to Los Angeles on the advice of rockabilly singer-guitarist Rosie Flores. He played in the house band at the legendary Palomino Club in Hollywood for a couple years and recorded a few singles before moving to Nashville to write songs for a publishing company run by Gary Morris (writer of such country/pop hits as \u201cThe Wind Beneath My Wings\u201d). Commercial country did not fit the fiercely independent songwriter so Dale relocated to Austin, Texas where he got a record deal and wrote several songs poking fun at the industry side of Nashville, including \u201cNashville Rash\u201d from his Hightone debut Cheatin\u2019 Heart Attack and \u201cA Real Country Song\u201d from his 1996 follow-up Blessed or Damned.\nAfter making three albums with Hightone, Dale released The Trucking Sessions on Koch Records in 1998. Including 14 original driving songs, the album received high praise and caused critics to compare him to chart-topping writer Red Simpson, who was responsible for some of the most iconic trucking tunes in country music.\nJust two years after this success, Dale\u2019s fiancee died in a car accident. As chronicled in the Zalman King documentary Crazy Again(2006), he turned to drugs and alcohol to cope with her loss and nearly died of an overdose. Dale then checked himself into a mental institution and left a year later, releasing his tribute album to her called Every Song I Write Is For You (2001). After recording a few more albums, he decided to take a break from touring and moved to Maryland to be closer to his daughters.\nBack in Texas and on the road in 2006, Dale has been trucking ever since, touring around the world and acting in films (The Thing Called Love, On the Borderline), on television (Friday Night Lights) and most recently, on stage in Ghost Brothers of Darkland County, a southern gothic musical by Stephen King and John Mellencamp . His rumbling baritone has also been heard on commercials for Shell, Monster.com and On the Border Restaurants.\nDale signed with Red House Records in 2011 to release his 20th album called The Sun Sessions. Hailed as \u201cone of the best country albums of the year\u201d (Atlanta Journal Constitution), it was recorded at Memphis\u2019 legendary Sun Studios with The Texas Two (bassist Chris Crepps and drummer Mike Bernal) in the stripped-down style of Johnny Cash\u2019s earliest recordings. He followed this with El Rancho Azul, 14 fresh honky tonk originals about marriage, heartbreak and honkytonkin\u2019, which propelled Dale into the national spotlight with multiple appearances on late-night television and NPR.", "name": "Dale Watson In Store Performance and Signing @ Schoolkids Records-Raleigh"}{"description": "Sum + Substance shares the stories of people who have created purpose and meaning in their jobs.

There\u2019s a case to be made that it sounds and acts a bit like solo-era John Lennon, Scott Walker, Randy Newman, Harry Nilsson, and Dory Previn, while taking more than a few cues from Woody Allen, Kurt Vonnegut, Alejandro Jodorowsky and Muhammad Ali. Blammo. It has a decidedly more soulful presence than Fear Fun, due in no small part to the fact that I am truly singing my ass off all over this motherfucker. The album is really characterized by the scope and ambition of the arrangements. Nearly every tune is augmented by something special, be it orchestral strings, a mariachi band, questionable electronic drum solos, ragtime jazz combos, soul singers, or what have you. I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s a sitar in there somewhere. Blammo.\n\n\u201cI Love You, Honeybear\u201d is a concept album about a guy named Josh Tillman who spends quite a bit of time banging his head against walls, cultivating weak ties with strangers and generally avoiding intimacy at all costs. This all serves to fuel a version of himself that his self-loathing narcissism can deal with. We see him engaging in all manner of regrettable behavior.\n\nIn a parking lot somewhere he meets Emma, who inspires in him a vision of a life wherein being truly seen is not synonymous with shame, but possibly true liberation and sublime, unfettered creativity. These ambitions are initially thwarted as jealousy, self-destruction and other charming human character traits emerge. Josh Tillman confesses as much all throughout.\n\nThe album progresses, sometimes chronologically, sometimes not, between two polarities: the first of which is the belief that the best love can be is finding someone who is miserable in the same way you are and the end point being that love isn\u2019t for anyone who isn\u2019t interested in finding a companion to undertake total transformation with.\n\nI won\u2019t give away the ending, but sex, violence, profanity and excavations of the male psyche abound.\n\nMy ambition, aside from making an indulgent, soulful, and epic sound worthy of the subject matter, was to address the sensuality of fear, the terrifying force of love, the unutterable pleasures of true intimacy, and the destruction of emotional and intellectual prisons in my own voice. Blammo.\n\nThis material demanded a new way of being made, and it took a lot of time before the process revealed itself. The massive, deranged shmaltz I heard in my head, and knew had to be the sound of this record, originated a few years ago while Emma and I were hallucinating in Joshua Tree; the same week I wrote the title track. I chased that sound for the entire year and half we were recording. The means by which it was achieved bore a striking resemblance to the travails, abandon and transformation of loving someone. There: I said it. Blammo.\u201d\n\nMikal Cronin\n\nMCIII is the third album from Californian singer-songwriter Mikal Cronin.

Are your engaging your head, heart, and hands?\n\nDoes your church already have community partnerships or do you run your own food pantry or homeless outreach? Or maybe you're just beginning your compassion and justice journey.\n\nCome to VJN 2015 to get the resources you need to dive deeper into ending poverty in your community and developing a Kingdom, Jesus-centered approach to the poor.\n\nA Forum on Ending Poverty\n\nThis year, we're focusing our time on one of VJN's key issues: Ending Poverty. We will tackle it through unpacking the relationship between Jesus, the Kingdom, and the Poor.\n \nHow do churches pursuing the Justice of the Kingdom be culturally relevant to the poor and marginalized communities in their own backyard?  \nWhat does reconciliation (with God and with each other) look like in your neighborhood/town/city?\n\nHow do compassion and mercy lead us to justice?\nWhat does the mission of God (Jesus) have to do with justice?  \nHow do you transition your church, small group, ministry, or church-plant to be more missional in identifying and addressing poverty within your own community?\nHow can your children's ministry and youth group integrate a Kingdom approach to serving alongside the poor?\n \nWhy do we need a Vineyard Justice Network?\n\nVineyard Justice Network (VJN) does not exist to promote a singular ministry, nor are we trying to start a non-profit for Vineyard USA. Instead, we're focusing on bringing together our Vineyard church pastors and leaders who are already tackling one of the three targeted areas of structural, systemic injustice: human trafficking, poverty, and the environment.\n\nVJN offers a new space to have conversations that either aren't happening, are happening in isolation, or are sporadic. Within our movement, we so rarely even celebrate or highlight the significant justice work that is going on in our Vineyard churches.  We recognize that it is essential for existing Vineyard pastors and leaders to shape the conversation with an \"inside-out\", rather than a \"top-down\" approach.\n\nIn particular, part of the leading edge of VJN points to the question: what does it look like and mean for the poor to lead the way in ending poverty? This can be reframed to: what does it look like and mean for the exploited to lead the way in ending exploitation, the trafficked to lead the way in ending trafficking, the homeless to lead the way to ending homelessness, the undocumented immigrant to lead the way in immigration reform?\n\nSchedule\n\nFriday, October 16\n\n4:30-6:00 PM     Registration\n\n6:00-7:00 PM     Dinner (provided on site)\n\n7:00-9:00 PM     Session 1: \u201cShaping Our Community View\u201d.

He retains active involvement in church and community activities. Dr. Turner held positions within Duke University in student affairs and Afro-American Studies before joining the Divinity School faculty. Before that, he played football for Duke. He is the pastor of Mt. Level Baptist Church in Durham.\n\nSaturday, October 17\n\nHugh Hollowell Executive Director, Love Wins | Raleigh, NC\n\nHugh Hollowell is the founder and executive director of Love Wins Ministries, where they believe the opposite of homelessness isn't housing, but that the opposite of homelessness is community. In addition to his duties there, he is a sought after writer and speaker about issues of faith and homelessness, having been published inSojourners, The Christian Century, and has appeared on both Fox News and NPR. Hugh lives in downtown Raleigh, North Carolina with his wife, where they co-parent two cats and four chickens. He stays pretty busy, but still manages to read over 100 books a year. With apologies to Counting Crows, grey really is his favorite color, and he loves peanut M&Ms.\n\nLiz Theoharis Co-Director, Kairos Center | Founder & Coordinator, Poverty Initiative | NYC\n\nThe Reverend Dr. Liz Theoharis is the Co-Director of the Kairos Center and a Founder and the Coordinator of the Poverty Initiative. She has spent the past two decades organizing amongst the poor in the United States, working with and advising grassroots organizations with significant victories including the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, the Vermont Workers Center, Domestic Workers United, the United Workers Association, the National Union of the Homeless and the Kensington Welfare Rights Union. She has led hundreds of trainings, Bible studies, and leadership development workshops; spoken at dozens of conferences and keynote presentations across the US and globally; and published several articles and book chapters sharing her vision that poverty can be ended and that the poor can be agents of social change. Liz received her BA in Urban Studies from the University of Pennsylvania; her M.Div. from Union Theological Seminary in 2004 where she was the first William Sloane Coffin Scholar; and her PhD from Union in New Testament and Christian Origins. The title of her dissertation was \u201cWill the Poor Be with You Always\u2019: Towards a Methodological Approach of Reading the Bible with the Poor.\u201d Liz is an ordained minister in the Presbyterian Church (USA). \n\nBob Zellner Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee | Raleigh pending\n\nBorn on April 5, 1939 and raised in south Alabama, Dr. John Robert (Bob) Zellner has worked as an organizer, author, and speaker. During the 1960s, Bob, along with his former wife Dorothy, was a white Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) activist. By the late 1960s, conflicts surfaced in SNCC:  between college-educated staffers and those with little formal education; between outside activists and local people; there were disputes over administrative decisions, policy and strategy, gender inequities, and of course white involvement. In a decisive staff meeting in New Orleans May of 1967, in response to the request of Zellners to organize a SNCC project in a white working-class neighborhood of New Orleans, the new Central Committee resolved that \"the remaining five Caucasians or people considered to be Caucasians\" be fired. The Zellners moved on to begin Grass Roots Organizing Work, or GROW (sometimes referred to as \"Get Rid of Wallace\") that sought to build coalitions and alliances between poor blacks and whites. In this project, white organizers needed to work hand in hand with black activists and this meant forging solidarity deeper than coalitions or alliances.\n\nBrian Metzger Lead Pastor, Raleigh Vineyard | Raleigh\n\nBrian joined the Raleigh Vineyard family in August, 2012.  He\u2019s been married to Donna for almost 30 years and they have 3 adult children and two daughters-in-law. Brian enjoys stories, listenting to them and telling them.  He makes time for movies, comics and theology (not necessarily in that order). He loves Jesus and is working to see the Church become an outpost of heaven here on earth.  \n\nKathy Maskell VJN Steering Committee | Pastor of Discipleship, Blue Route Vineyard | PA\n\n Kathy Maskell is the pastor of discipleship at Blue Route Vineyard, and she also leads the Vineyard Justice Network. Raised by Buddhist parents in San Diego, Kathy began her eastbound journey by first studying literature and poetry at the University of Chicago. While there, she got rocked by Jesus\u2019s kindness and power. Kathy then pursued a teaching career, spanning from elementary to high school. While in New Haven, CT, Kathy worked for six years as the U.S. Advocacy Director of Love146, a leading anti-trafficking organization, and co-planted Elm City Vineyard Church. Kathy\u2019s M. Div. work at Union Theological Seminary (NYC) focused on the study of abolitionist movements, developing Biblical resources on justice and exploitation, and analyzing poverty as a root cause of human trafficking alongside leaders of poor-led organizations.\n\nDr. Michael Raburn Pastor, Vineyard North | Wake Forest, NC\n\nDr. Raburn grew up in Plant City, FL in a family deeply embedded in the Pentecostal movement. The son of a general contractor, Michael worked his way through college and graduate school in an array of blue and white collar jobs, all of which influenced his research and/or personal development in unintended (and sometimes surprising) ways. With over 20 years of ministry experience, Michael serves as lead pastor of Vineyard North in Wake Forest, NC. He earned a Ph.D. in theological ethics and public policy in 2013 at Duke University with a dissertation that focused on the ethical commitments that attended the birth and decline of the Pentecostal movement and has two books forthcoming: After Satisfaction: Explaining Atonement in a Post-Evangelical World and Ding Dong the Witch is Dead: A Eulogy to the Evangelical Movement. Michael and his wife Amy have seven children ranging in age from 22 to 2.\n\nBubba Justice senior pastor, Iverness Vineyard | AL pending\n\nI experienced poverty as a child due to my parents\u2019 divorce, my mother\u2019s lack of education and no paid child support. Our family had to rely on government programs, individual generosity and Christian organizations for food, healthcare and clothing. At the same time my grandmother was the co-founder and primary leader of a mission to alcoholics and homeless. She ran the Jimmie Hale Mission from 1944 until 1990. It is still in existence with shelters for men and women and drug rehab facility. I was called into ministry as a senior in high school, attended a year of Bible College and then completed an accounting degree.\n\nWhile in Bible College I felt God wanted me to get a degree in business and work in a secular environment. I have worked as a public auditor, finance manager and Chief Officer of various companies. While working in the secular field I continued to serve in a Vineyard church as a volunteer pastor with children, youth, prayer, small groups, etc. When we planted our church in 1994, the Lord gave us a prophetic word that we were to be a safe place for widows and orphans. For twenty years we have partnered with inner city ministries, teamed up with local government agencies who serve foster kids, supported school systems who had students with little or no food over the weekend. Both county and state officials have directed others churches to come to Inverness Vineyard Church to see how to effectively partner with them. At one point we increased the number of foster care families in our county by 40%.\n\nIn 2005, we spun off a separate non-profit organization Vineyard Family Service of Central Alabama in order to get grants available to faith based organizations but not to churches. VFS currently has a budget of $150,000. VFS currently feeds 500 children every weekend who have little or no food. They also are an alternative sentencing program for fathers who have not paid child support. In addition to all of the local activities we have engaged in, we have created programs for foster care and empowerment of the poor in Kenya.\n\nSteven Hamilton Steering Committee, VJN | Founder, Baltimore Vineyard Mission | MD\n\nSteven Hamilton seeks the Justice of the Kingdom as a disciple of Jesus. He is a Spiritual Director, community organizer and subversive catalyst for the Kingdom of God. Embracing a holisitc ministry of biblical justice, he has helped liberate and restore victims and survivors of human trafficking for over a decade. He has worked in both public and private endeavours in this area, in various roles with the Department of Homeland Security, as Chair for Public Awareness for the Maryland Human Trafficking Task Force and as a leader with Safe House of Hope. Steven is the founding leader of the Vineyard Urban Mission/Baltimore.\n\nDave Hanson Executive Director, Sunrise Outreach Center | Assistant Pastor, Yakima Vineyard\n\nSunrise Outreach Center utilizes a service model which includes the temporary provision of basic needs, Intervention that looks like restorative justice, and Prevention, focused on interrupting the cycle of intergenerational poverty. Dave will talk about SOC\u2019s objectives: feeding families, housing our homeless, organizational networking and community mobilization.\n\nDave Hanson is the founder and Executive Director of Sunrise Outreach Center. After a 30 year career in quality systems development, Dave received a calling for outreach. He and his wife Theresa sold or gave away most everything they owned and moved into the city limits of Yakima. Initially there was no salary; but through this period, with God\u2019s provision he says, Sunrise Outreach Center emerged.\n\n In their five years as an incorporated non-profit, SOC has become a County-wide Christian community development organization. Their mission is: Community solutions for hunger and homelessness. Their four objectives are: \u2018feeding families\u2019, \u2018housing the homeless\u2019, \u2018organizational networking\u2019 and \u2018community mobilization\u2019; the first two are what they do, the latter are essentially how they do them.

Their intricately arranged songs are built on thick grooves, driven by a powerhouse rhythm section and interlaced with swirling guitar and synth lines. On top of this rock solid foundation, lyrical jabs and swells that serve as both subject matter and rhythmic reinforcement are delivered by four distinct vocalists, all framed by tight horn lines and punctuated with left hooks and right angles.\n\nDigitonium (Techne Records), Turkuaz\u2019s second national LP release, has more of a Peter Gabriel and Talking Heads feel and evokes the best of the \u201980\u2019s dance music. Upon close examination, the Dada-esque slurry of words and lyrical imagery reveals Digitonium to be a concept album at its core. Repeated phrases are intertwined throughout, and themes of empowerment and self-actualization, glimpsed in metaphors borrowed from Plato\u2019s cave, a dystopian technological future and the archetypal characters of the myths of Avalon are developed through various tracks. Supported by transitional interludes, these elements make Digitonium feel like the score to an animated film, at times.\n\nFollowing a Summer packed with high profile festival performances throughout North America, Turkuaz will embark on a national club tour in support of this cross-over release, and they shine on stage, as well as in the studio. Constant, coast-to-coast touring over the last three years has earned the band a passionate, growing fan base.\n\nNow, with the support of comprehensive distribution, a commercial AAA, college and specialty radio campaign, first rate publicity, a growing retail presence and a national media partner presenting the tour, Turkuaz is poised to break out for a more mainstream audience.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n\nThe Frtiz: \nAfter four years of traveling the Southeast, steadily building a reputation as a live act not to be missed, Asheville-based quintet The Fritz played exceptionally strong sets at The Catskill Chill and The Bear Creek Music Festival in the Fall of 2014, and showed thousands of new fans what throngs of Southeastern music lovers have known for years: The Fritz likes to get funky. As much as they take their funk seriously, the band takes it\u2019s songwriting just as seriously, but the well-crafted song is not the final product in the live forum\u2026 and this is where they shine, as The Fritz are masters of improvisation, carefully weaving the personality of the band and the crowd into each performance.", "name": "Turkuaz with The Fritz | The Pour House | Raleigh, NC"}{"id": "143709579304893", "start_time": "2015-09-25T21:00:00-0400", "place": {"id": "190651044348636", "name": "The Pour House Music Hall", "location": {"city": "Raleigh", "zip": "27601", "country": "United States", "longitude": -78.636879, "state": "NC", "street": "224 S Blount St", "latitude": 35.7771683}}, "description": "Mocktallica-classic Metallica Tribute,Hell Awaits,Tornado of Souls,and Among the Living", "name": "Big 4-Tributes to Slayer,Metallica,Megadeth and Anthrax-Raleigh,NC"}{"id": "1612176802353665", "start_time": "2015-09-26T09:00:00-0400", "place": {"id": "239920079383379", "name": "Walmart Mac Arthur", "location": {"city": "Beckley", "zip": "25873", "country": "United States", "longitude": -81.221793220145, "state": "WV", "street": "1881 Robert C Byrd Dr", "latitude": 37.754093192508}}, "end_time": "2015-09-26T15:00:00-0400", "name": "Raleigh County Special Olympics Tag Day/Bake Sale/Hot Dog Sale"}{"description": "Express yourself!

But the angular blues guitar lick over the top of the track is clue to a deeper, older invocation, as Son Little's lyrics bear witness to two departed friends, and, inspired by Trayvon Martin, offer a meditation on the ease with which black lives are erased \u2013 even now, decades beyond the years when that smoky guitar line was invented. Son Little's voice soars like a young Stevie Wonder's as he testifies to his loss, and the \"cross my heart\" tag line reveals itself not as a lover's plea, but a defiant prayer to remember the lost.", "name": "Cat's Cradle Presents Lord Huron with Son Little at The Ritz (Raleigh)"}{"description": "Lineup:\n-----------------\nGlass Animals http://bnds.in/RBsBIu\n\nBuy Tickets: http://bnds.in/1eNHerh\nFind Local Concerts: http://bnds.in/jlStT0", "start_time": "2015-10-13T20:00:00-0400", "place": {"id": "103879976317396", "name": "Raleigh, NC", "location": {"latitude": 35.8188, "city": "Raleigh", "state": "NC", "longitude": -78.6446, "country": "United States"}}, "end_time": "2015-10-13T23:00:00-0400", "id": "463009473858806", "name": "Glass Animals @ The Ritz in Raleigh, NC"}{"id": "1410667642574959", "start_time": "2016-04-18T10:00:00-0400", "place": {"id": "106003956105810", "name": "Boston, MA", "location": {"latitude": 42.3578, "city": "Boston", "state": "MA", "longitude": -71.0617, "country": "United States"}}, "description": "Congratulations on your The Boston Marathon qualification!\n\nThis fb event post was created to connect local area runners who plan on running Boston 2016, hoping we can possibly train together and plan similar travel arrangements.\n\nNote: I have nothing to do with the event itself or the qualification process.   :)   (Unfortunately, I don't have the power to \"qualify\" anyone.)

RCAR takes in abandoned, abused, injured, and homeless animals. These animals are fostered in the homes of RCAR volunteers. At the time, the animal is spayed or neutered, given their vaccines and provided any medical care the animal may require. Since 2003, RCAR has spayed and neutered approximately 10,000 animals and has adopted almost 9,000 kitties and 2,000 doggies. In addition, RCAR operates a Spay/Neuter Program for low income residents. Spaying and neutering is the only proven way of stopping overpopulation of unwanted pets. Volunteers transport pets to a low-cost spay/neuter clinic in Barboursville, WV. RCAR pets are available for adoption on-line at Petfinder.com, Adopt-A-Pet, Weebly/Raleigh County Animal Rescue, and Facebook. Pets are also available for adoption at PetSmart-Beckley, PetSmart-Charleston and sometimes at Pet Supplies Plus. All money collected by Raleigh County Animal Rescue goes directly to the care of the animals. All donations are tax deductible. \n\n\n \nIf you are interested in entering yourself or your team/ business/ organization in the Cook Off, please contact our Event Coordinator Kristen Mann at (304)888-6503- krspic@gmail.com or the Reservation Team at Skyline at (304)787-6201, skylineresort@outlook.com.\n\nWe will also be offering a $50 Room Special for this event!
